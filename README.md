2. Install the dependencies

```bash
# with the command runner
just install

# with npm
npm install
```

3. Open the slideshow locally

```bash
# with the command runner

# with npx
npx slidev --open -- slides.md
```

## 🤗 contributing

Install the dependencies [above](,/README.md#%EF%B8%8F-how-to-run) (`just` is highly recommended) and the following:

* [`commitizen`](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) is a release management tool. It's used to release new versions.

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your own branch.
3. Before opening a PR, run the following:

```bash
just test-release
```

This will format the slides, try to build them and test whether a version bump is possibile.
